Unofficial Ableton Live Discord rich presence for macOS

## DISCLAIMER 
This experimental rich presence client is self-hosted (i.e. on your own Discord developer portal) and making some rudimentary modifications to your Ableton Live installation. On macOS, applications are actually directories, with a runner to execute any code - along with the assets needed to execute said code - inside that directory. If this is something you are not comfortable with, or have no idea what the heck you're doing, please stop here.

## Stuff needed

1. Existing Discord account
2. Any Discord client (preferably the official one, pls; let's keep it halal thanks üôè)
3. Account on the Discord Developer Portal
4. An IDE to edit code
5. Ableton Live 12 Suite (this \*might\* work on Live 11 and Live 10 Suite with some minor tweaking, but I only have 12, so ymmv)
6. A functioning brain üß†

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo using 

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/KiwiSingh/AbletonRPC
```
2. Create a new application on your Discord Developer Portal, and fill in the deets as per the screenshots below.

3. Close Ableton Live in case it is open (obv. save any unsaved projects first)
4. Inside your Applications folder (or external drive, if you're a madlad who installed Ableton on an external SSD for some reason), right click `Ableton Live 12 Suite.app` and navigate to `/Applications/Ableton Live 12 Suite.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts`.
5. Inside the `MIDI Remote Scripts` folder paste the `FauxMIDI` folder from this repo.
6. Modify the `log_file_path = "/Volumes/Charidrive/rpctemp/CurrentProjectLog.txt"` line so that the value of `log_file_path` represents a path on your own system.
6a. In case the script throws any errors in stdout, create or delete said log file accordingly.
7. Inside of Terminal, navigate to the `FauxMIDI` folder and give read, write and execute permissions to the MIDI remote script. `chmod +rwx` the entire directory if needed.
8. Open up Ableton Live, and set up the `FauxMIDI` device which will interface with your Discord application, as per the below screenshot.

10. Create a new Python 3 virtual environment so that you don't bork up your existing install. Install the reqs needed by `abletonrpc.py` using

    ```zsh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    or
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
12. Open up the `abletonrpc.py` and replace the placeholder in `client_id = "Your Client ID"  # Replace with your actual client ID` with your actual client ID.
13. `chmod +x` the `abletonrpc.py` script
14. Fire up Discord if you haven't already. Remove Invisible status if enabled
15. Run `python abletonrpc.py` or `python3 abletonrpc.py`
16. Enjoy!


## Frequently asked questions
**Q.** Is this a port of DawRPC?
**A.** No, it is not. I wanted to make a port of DAWRPC, but since I only have Ableton Live and Studio One to experiment with, not to mention the fact that I would have to effectively reverse engineer a ton of Windows DLL and f*ck around in C#, I dropped the idea (at least for the timebeing).
**Q.** I get a `ModuleNotFound` error. Help!
**A.** This is most likely because you have not correctly initialized a virtual environment. Restart your shell if you have already installed all requirements.
**Q.** VS Code won't let me edit your Python script!
**A.** Refer to the answer above.
**Q.** Can I make a Discord bot/plugin/other self-hosted instance using this?
**A.** Sure. Go crazy. It's FOSS. Though please note that I do not condone using modified Discord clients, and if you end up getting into any trouble because of a plugin/self-bot, I am not liable. But since this project is FOSS, I cannot stop anyone from forking it and doing with it as they please.
**Q.** Is this safe? Will I mess up my Ableton install?
**A.** If you know what you're doing, this is completely safe. If you do not feel comfortable with such an involved solution, please look elsewhere.
**Q.** Where do I contact you regarding questions about this project?
**A.** You may reach out to my email address at [kiwisingh@proton.me](mailto:kiwisingh@proton.me)
